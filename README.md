# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

Bank App 

Overview


The Bank App is a mobile application designed to provide users with an easy and secure way to manage their finances. The app allows users to perform basic banking tasks such as logging in, managing accounts, making bill payments, and more. The app is built using React Native for the mobile frontend and integrates with backend services to ensure a smooth and seamless user experience.

Features
User Authentication: Secure login and sign-up functionality using a username and password.
Bill Payment: Allows users to pay their utility bills (electricity, water, etc.) directly from the app.
Account Management: Users can view their account balance, transaction history, and manage personal details.
Responsive UI: The app is designed with a user-friendly interface that works well on both Android and iOS devices.
Secure Data Handling: User information, including account details and payment history, is stored securely with proper encryption and validation.

Technologies Used
React Native: For building cross-platform mobile applications.
React Navigation: For seamless navigation between app screens.
Expo: For simplifying development with React Native.
Redux: For managing the state of the application.
React Hook Form: For handling form inputs in a streamlined manner.
Firebase (Optional): For backend services such as authentication and data storage.

npm start
# or
yarn start
Follow the instructions in the terminal to open the app in the Expo Go app or use an emulator.

4. Configure Backend (Optional)
If your app uses a backend service ( Node.js with Express), ensure you have set up your backend and configured the necessary environment variables for API keys, authentication, etc.

For example, if using Firebase:

bash
Copy
Edit
firebase init
5. Run the App
Once everything is set up, open the app on your device or simulator using Expo Go or your preferred emulator.
